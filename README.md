# Parachuter

<p align="center"><img height="500" src="/assets/demo.png" alt="Sample image of application"></p>

This is a simple physics program.  A stick figure is shown on the left of the screen and can do two things.  Fire thrusters (up or down), or open the parachute.  The graphs of the parachuter's displacement, velocity, and acceleration are shown on the right in a random color.  Students then must guess which graph is which, and are then shown the answers.

This was developed using pygame.  All sprites are made by me.  Executables can be found in the releases for both Windows and macOS.
